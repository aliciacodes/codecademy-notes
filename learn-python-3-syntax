# Welcome 

Python is a **programming** language. 

Programming languages help to **communicate** ideas between humans and computers.

These languages have set **commands** so the computer understands how to carry out your idea. 

To convey the commands we want the computer to do, we must write them in a text file using a programming language such as Python. 

These files are called *programs*. 

In order to have the computer hear your commands, you must run them which causes the computer to read the test file, translate it into a set of operations it understands, and perform those actions. 



<u>Activity</u>

1. Change `Codecademy` to your name and run the program.

Given:

```python
my_name = "Codecademy"
print("Hello and welcome " + my_name + "!")
```

My Solution:

```python
my_name = "Alicia"
print("Hello and welcome " + my_name + "!")
```



# Comments

*Comments* tell the computer that it should ignore that part of the program.

In Python, anything after a  `#`  is a comment

Comments can:

- Provide context for why code is written the way it is:

  ```python
  #This variable counts the number of rainy days in a month
  rainy_count = 0
  ```

  

- `Help` those reading your code understand it faster

  ```python
  #This code will calculate the likelihood of being struck by lightning 
  struck_by_lightning_odds()
  ```

  

- Ignore a line of code to see how the program will run without it

  ```python
  #useful_value = old_sloppy_code()
  useful_value - new_clean_code()
  ```

  

<u>Activity</u>

1. Documentation is a very important step in programming. You should write a comment describing your first programming

   

My Solution

```
# My very first program will say "Hello World"!
```



# Print

Through this, we can tell the computer to communicate to us.

Computers can answer many questions such as how, why, or what a program is doing at any particular time. 

In Python, the print() function is used to get the computer to talk, like this:



```python
# from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
print("There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand.")
```



In the example, we tell the program to `print()`an excerpt from the book. The computer runs the program. Then, these printed words appear as a result of the function which is called *output*. The output of this program would be:

```python
There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand
```



<u>Activity</u>

1. Print the greeting "Hello world!"

   

My Solution

```python
print("Hello world!")
```



# Strings

Computer programmers refer to a block of text as *strings*. 



"Hello world!" is a string.



In Python, a string is either surrounded by double quotes ( `"Hello world"`) or single quotes (`'Hello world'`). It doesn't matter which you use, but be consistent. 



<u>Activity</u>

1. Print your name using the `print()` command

   My solution (single quotes):

```python
print('Alicia')
```

​      My solution (double quotes):

```python
print("Alicia")
```



2. If your print statement uses double quotes `"`, change them to single quotes `'`. If it uses single quotes `'` , change them to double quotes

My solution (single quotes)

```python
print("Alicia")
```

My solution (double quotes)

```python
print('Alicia')
```



Try running your code again after switching the type of quote-marks. Is anything different about the output?

Solution: Nothing changes, everything is the same!



# Variables

Programming languages offer a method of storing data that's reusable. If there is a greeting we want to use multiple times, a date that needs to be changed often, or a user ID we need to remember we can create a *variable* which can store a value. In Python, the assignment of variables to a value occurs in the equals sign (`=`). 

```python
message_string = "Hello there"
#This prints "Hello there"
print(message_string)
```

In the above example, we store the message "Hello there" in a variable named `message_string`.  

Variables cannot have spaces or symbols other than an underscore (`_`). They can't begin with numbers, but can have numbers after the first letter (e.g. `bit_5` is acceptable). 



If the context of the program changes, we can update a variable to have a different value, but perform the same logical process upon it. 

```python
#Greeting
message_string = "Hello there"
print(message_string)

#Farewell
message_string = "Hasta la vista"
print(message_string)
```

Above, the variable `message_string` is created, assigns the welcome message, and prints the greeting. After we greet the user, we want to wish them goodbye. So, the `message_string` is updated to a departure message and printed out. 



<u>Activity:</u>

1. Update the variable `meal` to reflect each meal of the day before we print it.

   Code provided:

   ```python
   # We've defined the variable "meal" here to the name of the food we ate for breakfast
   meal = "An english muffin"
   
   #Printing out breakfast
   print("Breakfast:")
   print(meal)
   
   # Printing out lunch
   print("Lunch:")
   print(meal)
   
   # Now update "meal" to be dinner
   
   # Printing out dinner
   print("Dinner:")
   print(meal)
   ```

   My solution

   ```python
   # We've defined the variable "meal" here to the name of the food we ate for breakfast!
   meal = "An english muffin"
   
   # Printing out breakfast
   print("Breakfast:")
   print(meal)
   
   # Now update meal to be lunch!
   meal = "A salad"
   
   # Printing out lunch
   print("Lunch:")
   print(meal)
   
   # Now update "meal" to be dinner
   meal = "Spaghetti"
   
   # Printing out dinner
   print("Dinner:")
   print(meal)
   
   ```

   

# Errors 

Humans make mistakes fairly often. To help, programming languages attempt to understand and explain mistakes made to the coder.



Python refers to these mistakes as *errors* and will point out where the error occurred with a `^`. When programs throw unexpected errors, we call these *bugs*. Programmers call the process of updating the program so it has no unforeseen errors is called *debugging*.



Two common errors that we encounter are `SyntaxError` and `NameError`.

- `SyntaxError` means there is something wrong with how the program is written - punctuation that doesn't belong, a command that's unexpected, or a missing parenthesis. 
- A `NameError` occurs when Python doesn't recognize a word or a variable you are creating isn't defined properly.



<u>Activity</u>

1. You might encounter a `SyntaxError` if you open a string with double quotes and end it with a single quote. Update the string so it starts and ends with the same punctuation. 

   Given:

   ```python
   print('This message has mismatched quote marks!")
   ```

   Solution:

   ```python
   print("This message has mismatched quote marks!")
   ```

   or:

   ```python
   print('This message has mismatched quote marks!')
   ```



2. You might encounter a `NameError` if you try to print a single word string, but fail to put any quotes around it. Python expects the word of the string to be defined elsewhere, but can't find the exact place it's defined. Add double or single quotes to get rid of the bug.

   Given

   ```python
   print(Abracadabra)
   ```

   Solution

   ```python
   print('Abracadabra')
   ```

   or

   ```python
   print("Abracadabra")
   ```



# Numbers

Computers can understand more than strings of text. Python has a few numeric *data types*. It has multiple ways of storing numbers. Which one you use depends on your intended purpose.

An *integer* or `int` is a whole number. It has no decimal and contains positive and negative numbers as well as 0 (think 0, -1, 1, -2, 2). If you were counting the number of people at a party or number of keys on a key chain this is what you would use.

A *floating-point number*, or a `float`, is a decimal number. It can be used for fractional quantities as well as precise measurements. Measuring the length of a wall, batting averages in baseball, or GPA are when you would likely use a `float`.

Numbers can be assigned to variables or literally in the program. 

```python
an_int = 2
a_float = 2.1

print(an_int + 3) #This prints 5
```

1. Above, an integer and a float were defined as `an_int` and `a_float` respectively. We printed out the sum of the variable `an_int` and the literal number 3. A *literal* means that the number is 3 not a variable that has the value 3 assigned to it. 

Floating points may behave in unexpected ways due to how the computer stores them. 



<u>Activity</u>

1. A recent movie-going experience has you excited to publish a review. You rush out of the cinema and hastily begin programming to create your movie-review website: *The Big Screen’s Greatest Scenes Decided By A Machine*.

   Create the following variables and assign integer numbers to them: `release_year` and `runtime`.

   

   Solution:

   ```python
   # Define the release and runtime integer variables below:
   release_year = 2020
   runtime = 90
   
   # Define the rating_out_of_10 float variable below: 
   ```

   

2. Now, create the variable `rating_out_of_10` and assign it a float number between one and ten.

   ```python
   # Define the release and runtime integer variables below:
   release_year = 2020
   runtime = 90
   
   # Define the rating_out_of_10 float variable below: 
   rating_out_of_10 = 10.0
   ```



# Calculations

Computers are really good at performing calculations. The "compute" in the name comes from historical association with providing answers to mathematical questions. 

Python performs addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

```python
#Prints "500"
print(573 - 74 + 1)

#Prints "50"
print(25 * 2)

#Prints "2.0"
print(10 / 5)
```

When division is performed, the result has a decimal place. Python converts all `int` s to `float`s before the division operation. This conversion didn't happen in earlier versions of Python and it rounded down to nearest integer.



Division can throw its own error: `ZeroDivisonError`. Python will raise this error when attempting to divide by 0.



Python uses order of operations for mathematical operations. 



<u>Activity</u>

1. Print out the result of this equation:

   `25 * 68 + 13 / 28`

Solution

```python
print(25 * 68 + 13 / 28)
```



# Changing Numbers

Variables that are assigned numeric values are treated the same as literal numbers.  Two variables can be added together, divide, and multiplied by a third variable without Python distinguishing between variables and literals. 

Performing arithmetic on variables doesn't change the variable. Variables are only updated using the equals (`=`) sign.

```python
coffee_price = 1.50
number_of_coffees = 4

# Prints "6.0"
print(coffee_price * number_of_coffees)
# Prints "1.5"
print(coffee_price)
# Prints "4"
print(number_of_coffees)

# Updating the price 
coffee_price = 2.00

# Prints "8.0"
print(coffee_price * number_of_coffees)
# Prints "2.0"
print(coffee_price)
# Prints "4"
print(number_of_coffees)
```

Two variables are created and have numeric values assigned to them. Then calculations are performed and it doesn't update the variables. When `coffee_price` is updated and the calculations are performed again, the results are different and updated based on $2 instead of $1.50.



<u>Activity</u>

1. You’ve decided to get into quilting! To calculate the number of squares you’ll need for your first quilt let’s create two variables: `quilt_width` and `quilt_length`. Let’s make this first quilt 8 squares wide and 12 squares long.

2. Print out the number of square you'll need to make the quilt!

3. It turns out the quilt requires a little more material than what is on hand! Let's only make the quilt 8 squares long. How many square will you need for the quilt instead?

   ```python
   #Part 1
   quilt_width = 8
   quilt_length = 12
   
   #Part 2
   print(quilt_width*quilt_length)
   
   #Part 3 
   quilt_length = 8
   print(quilt_width*quilt_length)
   ```



# Exponents 

Python can perform exponentiation. In written math, exponents are superscript number, but typing superscript numbers isn't easy on normal keyboards. Since the operation is related to multiplication, we use `**`.

```python
# 2 to the 10th power, or 1024
print(2 ** 10)

# 8 squared, or 64
print(8 ** 2)

# 9 * 9 * 9, 9 cubed, or 729
print(9 ** 3)

# We can even perform fractional exponents
# 4 to the half power, or 2
print(4 ** 0.5)
```

Above some simple exponentiation was done. We calculate 2 to the 10th power, 8 to the second power, 9 to the third power, and 4 to the 0.5th power.



<u>Activity</u>

1. You really like how the square quilts from last exercise came out, and decide that all quilts that you make will be square from now on.

   Using the exponent operator, print out how many squares you’ll need for a 6x6 quilt, a 7x7 quilt, and an 8x8 quilt.

2. Your 6x6 quilts have taken off so well, 6 people have each requested 6 quilts. Print out how many tiles you would need to make 6 quilts apiece for 6 people.

   

   Solution

   ```python
   # Calculation of squares for:
   # 6x6 quilt
   print(6 ** 2)
   # 7x7 quilt
   print(7 ** 2)
   # 8x8 quilt
   print(8 ** 2)
   
   # How many squares for 6 people to have 6 quilts each that are 6x6?
   print(6 ** 4)
   ```

   



# Modulo

Python has a companion to the division operator called the modulo operator. The modulo (`%`) operator gives the remainder of a division calculation. If the number is divisible, then 0 will be the result.

```python
# Prints 4 because 29 / 5 is 5 with a remainder of 4
print(29 % 5)

# Prints 2 because 32 / 3 is 10 with a remainder of 2
print(32 % 3)

# Modulo by 2 returns 0 for even numbers and 1 for odd numbers
# Prints 0
print(44 % 2)
```

Above, modulo operators are used to find the remainder of division operations. We see that `29 % 5` equals 4, `32 % 3`equals 2, `44 % 2` equals 0. 



The modulo is useful for wanting to perform an action every nth time the code is done. The result of the modulo can never be larger than the divisor.



<u>Activity</u>

1. You’re trying to divide a group into four teams. All of you count off, and you get number 27. Find out your team by computing 27 modulo 4. Save the value to `my_team`.

2. Print out `my_team`. What number team are you on?

3. Food for thought: what number team are the two people next to you (26 and 28) on? What are the numbers for all 4 teams?

   

   My Solution:

   ```python
   #Part 1
   my_team = 27 % 4
   
   #Part 2
   print(my_team)
   
   #Part 3
   print(26 % 4)
   print(28 % 4)
   ```

   

# Concatenation 

The `+` operator doesn't just add two numbers it can also "add" two strings. 

The process of combining two strings is called *string concatenation*

String concatenation creates a brand new string compromised of the first string's content followed by the second string's content with no spaces.

```python
greeting_text = "Hey there!"
question_text = "How are you doing?"
full_text = greeting_text + question_text

#Prints "Hey there!How are you doing?"
print(full_text)
```

Above, two variables are created to hold strings and concatenate them. 

Here is how to add a space between the two

```python
full_text = greeting_text + question_text

#Prints "Hey there! How are you doing?"
print(full_text)
```

If you need to concatenate a string with a number, you have to convert the number to a string first with the `str()` function. If you're trying to `print()` a numeric variable you can use commas to pass it as a different argument rather than converting it to a string.

```python
birthday_string = "I am "
age = 10
birthday_string_2 = " years old today!"

# Concatenating an integer with strings is possible if we turn the integer into a string first
full_birthday_string = birthday_string + str(age) + birthday_string_2

# Prints "I am 10 years old today!"
print(full_birthday_string)

# If we just want to print an integer 
# we can pass a variable as an argument to 
# print() regardless of whether 
# it is a string.

# This also prints "I am 10 years old today!"
print(birthday_string, age, birthday_string_2)
```

In general, `str()` can convert any variable from not being a string to being a string so they can be concatenated. We don't need to convert a number to a string for it to be an argument to a print statement. 

<u>Activity</u>

1. Concatenate the strings and save the message they form in the variable `message`. 

   Solution:

   ```python
   string1 = "Hello there. "
   string2 = "I am learning to code. "
   string3 = "You should learn with me. "
   string4 = "Learning to code in Python is awesome! "
   string5 = "There are lots of things to do "
   string6 = "and ideas to express"
   
   message = string1 + string2 + string3 + string4 + string5 + string6
   ```



# Plus Equals 

In Python, there is shorthand if you want to update variables. If you want to add onto the current value of a variable, there is a plus-equals (`+=`) operator.

```python
#You are a cat fosterer who currently has two foster kitten
number_of_foster_cats = 2

#The shelter assigns you another kitten
number_of_foster_cats += 1

#The shelter then tells you two of the cats got adopted
number_of_foster_cats -= 2

#new value after the minus and plus equals
print(number_of_foster_cats) #prints 1
```

So,  the operator takes the number of cats a person has over time and updates it instead of creating an entirely new variable each time.

```
kitten_caption = "Look at this cute kitten"
kitten_caption += "#pleaseadoptme"
```

You take a cute picture of the cat you have left needing a permanent home. You upload the picture on your social media account and make a caption. However, you forgot a hashtag so you use the += operator to add onto the post.

<u>Activity</u>

1. You go to the thrift store to buy some new clothes. You pick up a t-shirt, a sweatshirt, and some jeans. You want to calculate the cost beforehand to make sure you have enough cash on hand. Use the `+= `operator to modify the `final_price` to include all of these items.

   Solution

   ```python
   final_price = 0
   t_shirt = 3.00
   sweatshirt = 5.00
   jeans = 8.00
   
   final_price += tshirt
   final_price += sweatshirt
   final_price += jeans
   
   print("The final price is", final_price)
   ```

   

# Multi-line Strings

If we try to create a string that it is more than one line we will face a `SyntaxError`

The solution to this is multi-line strings which use three quotation marks (either `"""` or `'''`) instead of one. The string won't end until the next triple quote. 

```python
david_henry_thoreau = """ 
We need the tonic of wildness...At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be indefinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of nature.
"""
```

This quote is assigned to a variable and works even though it contains multiple linebreaks. 

NOTE: If a multi-line string isn't assigned to a variable or used in an expression it is treated as a comment.



<u>Activity</u>

1. Assign the following string to the variable `Shakespeare`.

```python
All the world‘s a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts.
```

Solution:

```python
Shakespeare = """
All the world‘s a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts.
"""
```
