Welcome to Bicycle World, the premier text-based bicycle shop! This shop is only accessible to programmers like you, who are familiar with the command line.

In this project, you’ll use the commands you learned to navigate and edit the filesystem of this special shop.

The starting filesystem is shown below. (Bicycle World recently changed owners, who named the main directory bicycle-world-ii.)

|   |   |—— heavyweight/
|   |   |—— lightweight/
|   |—— hardtail/
|—— racing/
    |—— road/
    |—— track/
