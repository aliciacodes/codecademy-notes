In this project, youâ€™ll use the commands you just learned to navigate through the files and directories of Daily Buzz, a national newspaper.

#Step 1: Print the working directory.
$ pwd

#Step 2: List all files and directories in the current working directory.
$ ls

#Step 3: With one command, change directories to the national/politics/ directory.
$ cd national/politics

#Step 4: List all files and directories in the working politics/ directory.
$ ls

#Step 5: In the politics/ directory, create a directory called elections/.
$mkdir elections

#Step 6: Change directories into the elections/ directory.
$ cd elections/

#Step 7: In the elections/ directory, make two files candidates.txt and issues.txt
$ touch candidates.txt
$ touch issues.txt

#Step 8: Change directories three levels up to the daily-buzz/ directory, and print the working directory.
$ cd ../../..

#Step 9: In the daily-buzz/ directory, make a directory called business/ and change directories into the business/ directory.
$ mkdir business
$ cd business

#Step 10: List all files and directories in the business/ directory.
$ ls

#Step 11: From the business/ directory, make a directory called startups/ and change directories into the startups/ directory.
$ mkdir startups
$ cd startups

#Step 12: Change directories one level up back to the business/ directory.
#From the business/ directory, make a directory that is a child of startups/, called disruptors/.
$ cd ..
$ mkdir startups/disruptors

#Step 13: From the business/ directory, make three files in the disruptors/ directory. 
#The files should be called tech.txt design.txt and education.txt.
$ touch startups/disruptors/tech.txt
$ touch startups/disruptors/design.txt
$ touch startups/disruptors/education.txt

#Step 14:
