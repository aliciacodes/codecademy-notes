#Lovely Loveseat. Tufted polyester blend on wood. 32 inches high x 40 inches wide x 30 inches deep. Red or white.

lovely_loveseat_description = """

"""

#Step 2: Great, now let’s create a price for the loveseat. Create a variable lovely_loveseat_price and set it equal to 254.00.

lovely_loveseat_price = 254.00

#Step 3: Let’s extend our inventory with another characteristic piece of furniture! Create a variable called stylish_settee_description and assign to it the following string:

stylish_settee_description = "Stylish Settee. Faux leather on birch. 29.50 inches high x 54.75 inches wide x 28 inches deep. Black."

#Step 4: Now let’s set the price for our Stylish Settee. Create a variable stylish_settee_price and assign it the value of 180.50.
stylish_settee_description = 180.50

#Step 5: Fantastic, we just need one more item before we’re ready for business. Create a new variable called luxurious_lamp_description and assign it the following:
#Luxurious Lamp. Glass and iron. 36 inches tall. Brown with cream shade.
luxurious_lamp_description = "Luxurious Lamp. Glass and iron. 36 inches tall. Brown with cream shade."

#Step 7: In order to be a business, we should also be calculating sales tax. Let’s store that in a variable as well.Define the variable sales_tax and set it equal to .088. That’s 8.8%.
sales_tax = 0.088

###Our First Customer

#Step 8: Our first customer is making their purchase! Let’s keep a running tally of their expenses by defining a variable called customer_one_total. Since they haven’t purchased anything yet, let’s set that variable equal to 0 for now.
customer_one_total = 0

#Step 9: We should also keep a list of the descriptions of things they’re purchasing. Create a variable called customer_one_itemization and set that equal to the empty string "". We’ll tack on the descriptions to this as they make their purchases.
customer_one_itemization = ""

#Step 10: Our customer has decided they are going to purchase our Lovely Loveseat! Add the price to customer_one_total.
customer_one_total += lovely_loveseat_price

#Step 11: Let’s start keeping track of the items our customer purchased. Add the description of the Lovely Loveseat to customer_one_itemization.
customer_one_itemization += lovely_loveseat_description + "\n"

#Step 12: Our customer has also decided to purchase the Luxurious Lamp! Let’s add the price to the customer’s total.
customer_one_total += luxurious_lamp_price

#Step 13: Let’s keep the itemization up-to-date and add the description of the Luxurious Lamp to our itemization.
customer_one_itemization += luxurious_lamp_description

#Step 14: They’re ready to check out! Let’s begin by calculating sales tax. Create a variable called customer_one_tax and set it equal to customer_one_total times sales_tax.
customer_one_tax = customer_one_total * sales_tax

#Step 15: Add the sales tax to the customer’s total cost.
customer_one_total += customer_one_tax

#Step 16: Let’s start printing up their receipt! Begin by printing out the heading for their itemization. Print the phrase "Customer One Items:".
print("Customer One Items:")
